# Simulating Language

Simon Kirby

This is a collection of Python notebooks for a course taught in the Centre for Language Evolution at Edinburgh showing how to model the evolution of language at all timescales - from individual utterances, through individual learning, cultural transmission, and biological evolution. This course covers many of the major research breakthroughs over the past two decades, and shows how easy it is to build simulations of language evolution. It is suitable for anyone, even without any background in coding, and uses only a very basic subset of Python throughout.
