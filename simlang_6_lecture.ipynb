    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lecture, and in the lab, we built a simple model of communication using matrices of \"association strengths\" between meanings and signals. A communication system was defined as a pair of such matrices. One, a **production matrix** with meanings on the rows and signals on the columns, the other a **reception matrix** with signals on the rows and meanings on the columns. These two matrices define respectively the relationship between meanings and signals for the sender and the receiver in a communication game. In order to determine which signal is produced for a particular meaning, we have been applying a *winner take all* procedure, where the signal with the highest association is picked (i.e. the column with the highest value for the particular meaning row). Similarly, to figure out what meaning would be received by the receiver for a signal, the same procedure is applied on the reception matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a simulation of many many rounds of communication in which random meanings are given to the sender, the relevant signals are produced and then decoded by the receiver. The *communicative accuracy* from such a simulation is simply the average score over these rounds. There are a couple of things to note about this. First, the number of trials in such a simulation determines *in part* how accurate an estimate of the communicative accuracy of a pair of matrices is. Generally speaking, the more trials you have, the less random decisions (such as which meaning is being signalled) matter and therefore how accurately the \"true\" communicative accuracy is estimated by the monte caro simulation. However, the degree of error you can expect for a given number of trials of the simulation is not straightforward to figure out. For example, if you have a perfect signalling system - i.e., one that guarantees communication will be successful on every trial - then it doesn't matter how many trials you have in the simulation since the communicative accuracy will always be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we could calculate communicative accuracy a different way, without using a simulation at all. It's fairly simple to work this out be hand using paper and pencil. Just go through each meaning in turn and work out which signal or signals will be produced for that meaning, and whether the receiver will get the right meaning if that signal is received. (There's another approach too. If you remember your linear algebra from school, you might realise that you can multiply the production and reception matrices together. Don't worry if this doesn't mean anything to you, but if you do remember how to multiply matrices, it's actually quite simple to get from there to the communicative accuracy directly.) However, we are going to persist with using simulation because it enables us to extend the model in a wide variety of ways as we shall see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to get from a production matrix/reception matrix pair to a communicative accuracy score, we can start to experiment with which particular pairs of matrices are communicative successful, and which ones are bad for communication. I suggested in the last lecture that *homonymy* would be bad for communication, but *synonymy* shouldn't make much of a difference. To really test this idea we need to vary the number of signals for a given set o meanings. This means typically using matrices that aren't square. In other words, they have a different number of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's a pair of matrices that embody a homonymous communication system:\n",
    "\n",
    "|.    |$s_1$|$s_2$|\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "|$m_1$|1    |0    |\n",
    "|$m_2$|0    |1    |\n",
    "|$m_3$|1    |0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "|.    |$m_1$|$m_2$|$m_3$|\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "|$s_1$|1    |0    |1    |\n",
    "|$s_2$|0    |1    |0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't enough signals to go round, so two of the meanings $m_1,m_3$ share the same signal $s_1$. The communicative accuracy of such a system will be $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, here is a pair of matrices that embody a synonymous system:\n",
    "\n",
    "|.    |$s_1$|$s_2$|$s_3$|$s_4$|\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "|$m_1$|1    |0    |0    |1    |\n",
    "|$m_2$|0    |1    |0    |0    |\n",
    "|$m_3$|0    |0    |1    |0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "|.    |$m_1$|$m_2$|$m_3$|\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "|$s_1$|1    |0    |0    |\n",
    "|$s_2$|0    |1    |0    |\n",
    "|$s_3$|0    |0    |1    |\n",
    "|$s_4$|1    |0    |0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are an excess of signals, and one meaning $m_1$ can be produced using two signals $s_1,s_4$. The communicative accuracy of such as system will be $1$. In other words the extra signals have no negative impact on the communicative utility of the system."

    "## Where do these signalling matrices come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been plugging in numbers into these matrices by hand and seeing what effect particular sets of numbers has on communication (and ultimately, communicative accuracy). Obviously, this isn't how real communication systems in nature are constructed! If we think about communication systems like primate alarm calls, these systems are typically *innate*. Although they unfold in the environment through a process of development, which itself relies on particular properties of the environment being present, the particular mapping between meanings and signals is somehow the end result of the signalling organism's genes. (Note that we'll get back to the interaction between genes and the environment and be more precise about what \"innate\" actually means in a later lecture.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how did the vervet monkey (or indeed any other successfully communicating species) end up with genes that coded for the \"right\" production and reception behaviours? How did their genes come to give them a communicative accuracy score approaching 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we need a theory, and the most obvious choice here is to propose that *natural selection* will give us organisms with genes that specify signalling systems which have high communicative accuracy. In a sense, we are treating communication like any other *adaptive* feature of an organism, whose existence is the result of biological evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we be sure that natural selection will indeed give rise to communicative optimality? It surely seems like a reasonable hypothesis, but what if there are hidden complexities that aren't immediately obvious to introspection. (Spoiler alert: there are!) This is where we need a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we get to the model, let's have a really quick summary of how natural selection works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution by natural selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural selection is the process by which genotypes with higher fitness incerase in frequency in a population. Genotype here just means the entire set of genes an organism possesses, and fitness is the expected number of offspring an organism will produce. (A quick note of warning here... we'll also be using \"fitness\" in a slightly less accurate sense when we come to simulations later, to mean roughly the relative success of an organism.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution by natural selection is the inevitable consequence of *heritable variation in fitness*. In other words, you're guaranteed to have this kind of evolution if there are differences in fitnesses in the population *and* these differences are inherited by offspring from their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a simple example. Imagine there is a population of monkeys with two different types of communication system. The X type and the Y type. Imagine further that the X-type monkeys are fitter than the Y type monkeys (e.g. because their communication system is better and they live longer and are therefore likely to have more babies). Furthermore, imagine that these babies tend to inherit their communication system from their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an initial population with 50% X monkeys and 50% Y monkeys:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/Population1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, some of the monkeys die before being able to reproduce (remember that the Y monkeys are not as fit so are likely to die first).\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/Population2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to keep things simple and imagine that every one of the survivors has 2 offspring so that the population size at the next generation remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/Population3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "What has happened is that we've gone from a population with 50% of the less fit Y monkeys to one in which the less fit monkeys make up only 20% of the population. It is easy to see that, over time, the population will come to be dominated by the most fit monkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, every now and then a mutation will occur, adding new variation into the set of genotypes. If the mutant is more successful than the rest of the population, then this may take over.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, natural selection leads to *adaptation*. As [Ridley (1995, p.5)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Evolution%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781405103459) puts it, adaptation is \"'design' in life - those properties of living things that enable them to survive and reproduce in nature.\" Adaptations are the appeareance of design in nature, or more specifically, adaptations are properties of living things that serve to increase fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because natural selection has been operating for as long as there has been heritable variation in fitness on the planet, then it should not be a surprise that we are surrounded by living things that appear to be exquisitely designed for the purposes of suriving and reproducing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming communication is a trait that could be useful for organisms in their survival (and ultimately production of offspring) then surely natural selection is an excellent candidate explanation for why good communication systems evolve."

    "## Modelling evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of building a simulation of evolution. The one we're going to explore in this course is loosely based on an engineering technique known as *genetic algorithms*. [Mitchell (1996)](https://archive.org/details/AnIntroductionToGeneticAlgorithmsMelanieMitchell) is an excellent textbook, and you should at least read up to page 16 to get an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key ingredients of our super simple model of evolution will be to have some kind of representation of a *genotype* (i.e. a set of genes for our agent) and a *phenotype* (i.e. the actual physical properties of the agent - in this case its signalling system).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model of evolution we need the following components in addition to the genotype and phenotype:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A population of agents\n",
    " - A task they are trying to succeed at (i.e. some kind of communication game)\n",
    " - A measure of how good they are at this task (we'll refer to this as how *fit* they are, although as I mentioned earlier this doesn't strictly speaking mean the number of offspring they will have)\n",
    " - A way of selecting the fittest\n",
    " - A way of allowing the genes of the fittest to survie into the next generation\n",
    " - A mechanism for introducing variation into the pool of genes in the population (i.e. mutations)\n",
    " \n",
    "### Our model\n",
    " \n",
    "We're going to simplify things a little bit. First we'll treat genotypes and phenotypes as equivalent. This basically means that our genetic representation of the signalling systems of our agents is basically identical to the signalling systems themselves. In other words, there is a one-to-one relationship between cells in an agent's signalling matrices and their genes. Each gene corresponds to one cell. What this is essentially doing is abstracting away completely from any kind of developmental process. The communication system of our agent is no more and no less than its genetic heritage. We'll return to the (considerable) consequences of this assumption in later lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we're going to get rid of sex for our agents. Rather than have each offspring arise from two parents, in our simulation, new agents are born asexually and inherit their genes from a single parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of idealisations are familiar to anyone building models of a complex phenomenon. It's part of the craft of model building to decide when and where to make simplifications - what aspects of reality to idealise away from. The risk is always that we make the wrong idealisations. For example, perhaps sexual reproduction will turn out to be important for the evolution of communication? In sense we have to make our best guess that it won't be, whilst still being open to the possibility that we might be wrong. Ultimately, if we build a theory on the back of certain idealisations, it is a good idea to try changing these idealisations to see whether our theory is robust. Often progress is made at just these points, where new idealisations are explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how our simulation is going to work, step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create an initial population of random signal matrices\n",
    "2. assess each member of the population for fitness (based on communication)\n",
    "3. pick a parent based on fitness\n",
    "4. copy parent (with chance of mutation) to create new offspring\n",
    "5. do steps 3 & 4 enough times to come up with a new population that's the same size as the old one\n",
    "6. replace old population with new one\n",
    "7. repeat steps 2 to 6 many many times\n",

    "### Main research question\n",
    "\n",
    "With this simulation of evolution, the question we want to answer is simply **under what conditions will we see the emergence of \"optimal\" communication systems?*** In other words, when (if ever) will we see a stable population of agents in which any pair of agents would have a communicative accuracy of 1.0?\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem a bit of a strange question at first. What do I mean by \"conditions\" here? Well, it turns out we've left an important feature of the simulation a little unspecified in our description in the last section. Specifically, we've not explained exactly how we calculate fitness (what is called, in the genetic algorithms literature, the *fitness function*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've simply said that we're going to assess members of the population based on communication. However, there are a number of ways we could do that. In modelling parlance, we say that there are a different *parameters* that we can alter in the way we asses fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ones that are worth exploring in particular. Specifically,\n",
    "\n",
    "- how do we pick communicative partners from the population?\n",
    "- and, who gets rewarded for successful communication, the sender or receiver?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out the way we assess fitness, and these two parameters in particular, are surprisingly important for determining whether optimal communication evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see why in the next two labs when we finish our model of the evolution of innate signalling."
