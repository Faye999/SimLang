    "The simulation in this notebook implements the learning of a signalling system. In the previous simulations, an individual agent’s signalling system was provided innately, and didn’t change in its lifetime. Populations of agents evolved through natural selection according to the fitness function we specified, to be ‘optimal’ in some way for communication.\n",

    "In this simulation, we’re ignoring evolution, and instead allowing the weights in an agent’s signalling system to change through learning, as a result of their experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of the code is similar to the code we used in our first simulation, when we introduced the following:\n",
    "- a signalling system is represented as a list of lists - you can think of this as a matrix or as a neural network.\n",
    "- how to produce a signal to express a meaning, using winner-take-all;\n",
    "- how to decide which meaning a received signal is expressing, using winner-take-all;\n",

From now on we are going to use a model where we just have a single matrix which handles both processes. There are some small changes to the code to accomplish this.\n",
