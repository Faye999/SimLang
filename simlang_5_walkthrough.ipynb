    "### Data Structures: a signalling matrix represented as a list of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A production system can be thought of as a matrix which maps meanings to signals. We are representing this as a list. Each member of the list is itself a list containing the association strengths for *one particular meaning*. Look at the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "psys = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1], [3, 4, 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a production system called `psys` is defined: it has three members, representing three meanings. The length of the system `len(psys)` is equivalent to the number of meanings in the system. `psys[0]` is `[1, 0, 0]`, which are the association strengths for the first meaning (remember python indexes start from 0!). Each of these sub-lists has three members, representing three possible signals. So `psys[0][0]` is the strength of association between the first meaning and the first signal. We sometimes refer to these association strengths as \"weights\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same thing to model a reception system, but in this case we are dealing with a system which maps from signals to meanings: so, if `rsys` is a reception system then each member of `rsys` is itself a list that contains the association strengths between a signal and several meanings."
